So it's been a hot minute, and I have moved the retro weblog to xc0py32.com. First I built [this site] it using HTML and Javascript, and yeah on the _whistler1_ (my Windows XP machine). But, I just re-built it using PHP and it's going to be so much easier to manage this way vs having to do this without it.

If, for some reason you're curious, you can see the [./media/v1.zip](code of that original site). I also went for a MS-DOS motif just for fun.

So how did I get here?

you see I'm a 30-someting guy who has always wanted to build a vintage Windows98 PC to play DOS games on, but mostly for nostagia. I landed on a Dell Dimension 4700 (I know, not that vintage-but I *was* going for something late 90's early 2000's and this was pretty close). I tried many times to get Windows 95, 98 and even Windows ME (NT) on it but drivers were an issue. So I just went with XP (what it was designed for) as I had the original driver disc's and here I am. I named the build _The WHISTLER_:

Some of the first things I did was:

- Connect it to the Internet (yes it works)
- Get some cool games installed
- Get it to look as much like Windows 98 and as Retro as I could

I then decided I wanted to blog about this, and here we are. As I said I first hosted a simple version of the blog I wanted to create at `aubrey.pw/d/blog/v1` and at first it was an experiment anyways. The experiment was could I build a blog _on_ the machine I created? So everything started off really rocky.

At first I didn't want to mess around with PHP or anything, I wanted to go really simple at first to see if I even wanted to do it this way. The [first version](./media/v1.zip) was pure HTML, no CSS, and Javascript. It was fun, but coding in [Notepad2](https://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) and debugging (or the lack of it) in [K-Meleon](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/) was difficult to say the least. So I decided to try and do a little better and try again.

## Finding an email

So one of the first things I knew I would need is an email. Again, I didn't want anything modern, I wanted to stick with the vintage-feel. Turns out getting email addresses from back-in-the-day is tough.
