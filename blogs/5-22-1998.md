<p class="lead">This content was written before the site you see now.</p>

So today I created this site, which was fun all-on-its-own. It's not PHP, but it is a self-made micro-framework (_yeah that's what I'm calling it-lol_):

![](media/screenshot-of-my-editing-this-post.GIF)

It's just HTML and JavaScript _(simple JavaScript too)_ and it dynamically loads content using `xhr` requests. Just <abbr title="Sorry, you can't anymore.">~~checkout~~</abbr> `header.js` and `footer.js`. And, as you can see I can integrate [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and render that as HTML which makes writing content a little easier.

Yeah, I straight-up did this via FTP using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org). But I do plan to version control it at some point. Probably not using Git or Github (might be too-new-of-a-technology).

But the machine I built is actually the most of what I've done, and my attempt to live in it's eco-system and try out old (now vintage) stuff.

More to come!
