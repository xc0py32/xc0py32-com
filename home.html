# Welcome

What you are viewing is a _retro weblog_ I am building on a Windows XP machine _from scratch_. You see, I got it in my head that I wanted to build a PC. I really missed that from my childhood, so I went out looking for one; an old one. What I found was a **Dell Dimension 4700** (_I know not the best_), and I was _not_ able to install Windows 98, which I wanted, but I was able to install Windows XP, which turned out fine because here I am!

I'm really happy with what I've created, and I've really enjoyed figuring things out and using the old tools I used to use. I also wanted to _blog_ my experience. But I wanted to do it legit, and so here I am. I have **Notepad ++** open, just like I used to, and am creating **v1** of a blog about my adventures on this machine, reliving the late 90's and early 2000's!
